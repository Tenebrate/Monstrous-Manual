  HOSTILE DRAGONS
-------------------

Shadow Dragon: Lairing deep underground, shadow dragons were once regular dragons that were irrevocably transformed by the influence of the Shadowfell. This has made them cruel and evil, if they weren't already before, and caused them to despise all life. Their breath weapon has been replaced with a necrotic blast and they are immune to necrotic damage.

Dragon Turtle: Resembling a gigantic turtle, these dragons are acquatic and utterly covetous. Their breath weapon is a jet of scalding steam. They can appear rarely in any ocean.
