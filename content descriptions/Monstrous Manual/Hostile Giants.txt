  HOSTILE GIANTS
------------------

Cyclops: This one-eyed giant is isolationist by nature and can be found living alone in savage mountains, grasslands and shrublands, or very rarely underground. They can, and probably will, destroy buildings that get in their way.

Ettin: A giant humanoid monster with a two quarreling heads with features resembling those of orcs. They are prone to rage, and are found in savage grasslands, shrublands, mountains or more rarely underground. They can destroy buildings.

Troll: :These horrid giantkin are often preceded by their foul smell. Trolls can and will eat anything they can get their hands on. They have incredible regenerating powers, which can sometimes lead to mutations. And though they are intelligent, they care little for organizing themselves and thus act either as roving monsters or as mercenaries. Trolls can be found in savage grasslands, shrublands, savannas, forests, wetlands, mountains, tundras, taigas or in any underground layer. They can destroy some buildings.
