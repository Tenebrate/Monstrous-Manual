  MEGABEAST CELESTIALS
------------------------

Empyreans: The celestial children of the good gods, empyreans are beautiful, gigantic and self-assured. By their very nature their emotions are much more volatile and stronger than those of mortals, which can cause them to overreact. These emotional swings can rarely corrupt an empyrean, who then flees to the mortal plane in an effort to carve themselves a realm there. They possess three spells: Restoration, which boosts recuperation; Fire Storm, which launches multiple fireballs; and Earthquake, which causes pain, necrosis and slows speed on multiple targets. They also have two non-magical interactions: Trembling Strike, in which they cause nearby creatures to slow down; and Bolster, an aura-like interaction that gives immunity to fear and boosts skill rolls of nearby friendlies.
