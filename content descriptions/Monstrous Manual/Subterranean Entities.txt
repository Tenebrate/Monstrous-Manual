NOTE: Unless pointed otherwise, all creatures here have the Humanoid type of creature.

Bugbear: Bugbears are brutish human-sized goblinoids that can be found underground. They can launch ambushes.

Drider: Created when a drow fails a trial set by Lolth the Spider Queen, they are transformed by the angered godess into a monstrous fusion of drow and giant spider as a living reminder of Lolth's power and displeasure to the rest of the drow. They can freely walk on walls, ignore webs and have a poisonous bite. They can launch ambushes.
